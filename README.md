# approximate_polynomial_root_calculator
This project is intended to operate as a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, perhaps in the form of a command-line interface.

primary.py is a sort of artifact from earlier forms of this project. There is currently no plan to include primary.py in the final program as how it is currently written, but it has been included in this repository for the case that parts of the module might be able to be re-used.
