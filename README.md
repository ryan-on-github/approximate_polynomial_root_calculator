# approximate_polynomial_root_calculator
This project is intended to operate as a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, perhaps in the form of a command-line interface.

Plan for chronology of the program:

    User-input is given.
    
    The input is parsed utilizing Python 3.7's stdlib Regular Expressions module,
    
    and tested for if it matches the program's model of a standard-form polynomial.
    
        In the first phase of parsing, individual terms are extrapolated from the original string
